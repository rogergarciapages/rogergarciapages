## Hello, Bonjour, 今日は**  I'm Roger👋

**`Revenue Manager, Data Analyst, SEO, Digital Craftsman & Tinkerer`**


I’m passionate about coding, from building side projects to writing Python scripts that automate repetitive tasks and make life easier. 
Whether it’s creating efficient solutions or exploring new technologies, I love tackling challenges and turning ideas into reality. 
My journey started with curiosity, and now coding has become both a tool and a creative outlet. 

Feel free to explore my repositories—there’s always something new in the works! 🚀
